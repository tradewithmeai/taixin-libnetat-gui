# Taixin LibNetat GUI

A cross-platform graphical user interface for the [Taixin LibNetat Tool](https://github.com/aliosa27/taixin_tools) by [aliosa27](https://github.com/aliosa27).

> **Attribution**: This GUI is a wrapper around the excellent Taixin LibNetat Tool created by aliosa27. All core functionality for device communication, AT commands, and network protocols is provided by the original project. This GUI simply provides a user-friendly interface to those powerful tools.
